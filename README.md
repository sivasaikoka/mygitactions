This appendix provides additional instructions for setting up and running the project, including cloning from GitHub, installing dependencies, setting up a virtual environment, and running the Django server.

## Cloning from GitHub

To clone the project repository from GitHub, use the following command:

#### git clone http://gitlab.dhanushinfotech.com/dhanush/dhanushhyderabad/vmed-pro/dhanush-ai.git

Replace `<project link>` with the URL of the GitHub repository.

## Installing Python

Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) .

## Optional Setup: Virtual Environment

To set up a virtual environment, navigate to your project directory and run the following command:

#### python -m venv <environment_name>


Replace `<environment name>` with the desired name for your virtual environment.

### Using virtualenv

If the `venv` module is not available, you can install virtualenv using pip:

#### pip install virtualenv


Then, create the virtual environment using:

#### virtualenv <environment_name>


## Installing Dependencies

After setting up the virtual environment, navigate to your project directory and install the required dependencies using the following command:

#### pip install -r requirements.txt


This command will install all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Downloading NLTK Libraries

If your project requires NLTK libraries, you can download them using the following command:

#### python -m nltk.downloader all


Alternatively, you can download specific packages using:

#### python -m nltk.downloader('package_name')


Replace `<package name>` with the name of the NLTK package you want to download.

## Migrating Database

If your project involves database migrations, run the following command to apply migrations:

#### python manage.py migrate


This command will synchronize the database schema with the current set of models and apply any pending migrations.

## Running the Server

Finally, to run the Django development server, use the following command:

#### python manage.py runserver


This command will start the development server, and you can access your application in a web browser at the specified URL (usually http://127.0.0.1:8000/).
